# 8-Ball Emulator X - Read Me

This Mac application puts a pool table on your screen and lets you shoot the balls down the pockets.  

Unlike other pool table applications, you can set the table and balls to any size you wish.  There are hundreds of settings available for speed and friction.  The Aim Assist feature shows you which direction and how far the cue ball will go when you shoot.  Shot Status information is provided, like a referee, to show whose turn it is, whether they've made a legal shot, whether a player has won the game, etc., according to rules for either 8Ball or 9Ball.

To see what sets 8-Ball Emulator apart from the rest, try minimum ball size and friction settings.

Full documentation is available thru the 'Save Help Text' button in the Help dialog.

To get started, launch the application and check out the 'Help' dialog.  This dialog appears the first time 8-Ball Emulator is launched on a particular system, and is available later through an item in the Apple menu.  You can try 8-Ball Emulator before you buy it.  However, you can only do 5 shots per day until you register.  

Good luck!
